// Unfortunate yet required hack for the missing typedefs of vendored libraries.
// The way this was done before was by placing a `lib.d.ts` next to the
// corresponding `lib.js`.
// However, vendored libraries have to be `.ts` files now due to ESBuild reading
// an import to `lib.js` as `lib.js.ts` due to disabling file extensions.
